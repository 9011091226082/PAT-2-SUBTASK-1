Morse Code: A Comprehensive Guide â€“ Eduindex News
Morse code is a method of communication that encodes text characters as standardized sequences of two different signal durations, called dots and dashes. 
It's named after Samuel Morse, one of the early developers of the system used for electrical telegraphy. Morse code can be transmitted as audible or visual signals,
and it's still used by some amateur radio operators and in certain maritime contexts. 
Key features of Morse code:

#Dots and dashes:
The core elements of the code are short signals (dots) and longer signals (dashes). 
Letters, numbers, and punctuation:
Each letter, number, and punctuation mark has a unique sequence of dots and dashes. 

#Spacing:
Spaces between letters, words, and sentences are also defined in Morse code. 
Transmission:
Morse code can be transmitted via sound, radio waves, or light flashes. 


#History and Use:
Developed in the 1830s and 1840s:
Morse code was developed by Samuel Morse and others during the telegraph's early development. 
Early communication method:
Before widespread use of other forms of communication, the telegraph and Morse code were vital for long-distance communication. 
Still in use:
Morse code is still used by some amateur radio operators and in certain maritime contexts for emergency communications. 

#How it works:
A message is written out using Morse code, with each letter, number, and punctuation mark translated into its corresponding dot-dash sequence. 
These dot-dash sequences are transmitted as electrical pulses, sound signals, or visual signals. 
At the receiving end, the signals are interpreted.
